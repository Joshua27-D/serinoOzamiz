            <p>
              The history of Ozamiz City is deeply intertwined with its role as a strategic trading and defense hub during the Spanish colonial period. In 1755, the Spaniards constructed Fort Santiago (Cotta Fort) to guard against pirate invasions, marking the city as a place of historical importance. The fort later became a symbol of resilience and faith, with the addition of the Birhen sa Cotta Shrine, a revered religious icon. Ozamiz officially became a city in 1948 and was named in honor of José Ozámiz, a notable Filipino hero and former senator. Over the decades, the city has grown into a dynamic and culturally rich community, balancing its historic legacy with modern progress.
